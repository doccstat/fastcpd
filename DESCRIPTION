Description: Implements fast change point detection algorithm based on the
    paper "Sequential Gradient Descent and Quasi-Newton's Method for
    Change-Point Analysis" by Xianyang Zhang, Trisha Dawn
    <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/zhang23b.html>. The algorithm
    is based on dynamic programming with pruning and sequential gradient
    descent. It is able to detect change points a magnitude faster than
    the vanilla Pruned Exact Linear Time(PELT). The package includes examples
    of linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression, penalized
    linear regression data, and whole lot more examples with custom cost
    function in case the user wants to use their own cost function.
