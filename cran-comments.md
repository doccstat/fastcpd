## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Reduced the length of the title to less than 65 characters.
* Expanded all acronyms in the description text.
* Added value fields to .Rd files / return fields to roxygen documentation
  regarding exported methods `plot`, `print`, `show`, `summary`.

NOTE: There might be an extra note about possibly misspelled words in
  DESCRIPTION. This comes from the first name and last name of the authors.
