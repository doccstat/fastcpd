## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Adjusted the examples so that the run time is less than 5 seconds.
* Removed C++17 requirement.
* Removed `Remotes` field in `DESCRIPTION` file.

NOTE: There might be an extra note about possibly misspelled words in
  DESCRIPTION. This comes from the first name and last name of the authors.
