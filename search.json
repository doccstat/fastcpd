The framework includes several well-established procedures, such as the penalized likelihood and minimum description length. Such an approach requires finding the cost value repeatedly over different segments of the data set, which can be time-consuming when (i) the data sequence is long and (ii) obtaining the cost value involves solving a non-trivial optimization problem. This paper introduces a new sequential updating method (SE) to find the cost value effectively. The core idea is to update the cost value using the information from previous steps without re-optimizing the objective function. The new method is applied to change-point detection in generalized linear models and penalized regression. Numerical studies show that the new approach can be orders of magnitude faster than the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) method without sacrificing estimation accuracy.}, }"},{"path":[]},{"path":"http://www.xingchi.li/fastcpd/index.html","id":"overview","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Overview","title":"Fast Change Point Detection Based on Dynamic Programming with Pruning\n    with Sequential Gradient Descent","text":"fastcpd (FAST Change Point Detection) fast implmentation change point detection methods R. fastcpd package designed find change points fast manner. easy install extensible kinds change point problems user specified cost function apart built-cost functions. ’d like learn use fastcpd effectively, please refer following references: Sequential Gradient Descent Quasi-Newton’s Method Change-Point Analysis","code":""},{"path":"http://www.xingchi.li/fastcpd/index.html","id":"installation","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Installation","title":"Fast Change Point Detection Based on Dynamic Programming with Pruning\n    with Sequential Gradient Descent","text":"’re compiling source, can run pak::pkg_system_requirements(\"fastcpd\"), see complete set system packages needed machine.","code":"# Install from CRAN, (not yet available) install.packages(\"fastcpd\") # Install the development version from GitHub # install.packages(\"pak\") pak::pak(\"doccstat/fastcpd\")"},{"path":"http://www.xingchi.li/fastcpd/index.html","id":"usage","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Fast Change Point Detection Based on Dynamic Programming with Pruning\n    with Sequential Gradient Descent","text":"library(fastcpd) load core fastcpd package full part: Rcpp, C++ source code compilation.
