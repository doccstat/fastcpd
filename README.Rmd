## Overview

The fastcpd (**fast** **c**hange **p**oint **d**etection) is a fast implmentation
of change point detection methods in R. The __fastcpd__ package is designed to
find change points in a fast manner. It is easy to install and extensible to
all kinds of change point problems with a user specified cost function apart
from the built-in cost functions.

If you'd like to learn how to use the fastcpd effectively, please refer to the following references:

* [Sequential Gradient Descent and Quasi-Newton's Method for Change-Point Analysis](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/zhang23b.html)

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN, (not yet available)
install.packages("fastcpd")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("doccstat/fastcpd")
```

If you're compiling from source, you can run `pak::pkg_system_requirements("fastcpd")`, to see the complete set of system packages needed on your machine.

## Dependency

`library(fastcpd)` will load the following packages:

* [Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp), for C++ source code compilation.
* [RcppArmadillo](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo), for fast linear algebra.
* [fastglm](https://github.com/jaredhuling/fastglm), for fast generalized linear models.
* [DescTools](https://github.com/AndriSignorell/DescTools), for Winsorizing Poisson data.
* [glmnet](https://glmnet.stanford.edu/), for penalized regression.
* [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), for data visualization.
